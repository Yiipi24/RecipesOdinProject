    <p>Ground Beef Tacos is one of our favorite weeknight family meals, especially on Taco Tuesdays! I have a quick homemade taco seasoning that I love to use for this recipe so I can cook the taco meat in 10 minutes. Give it a try and itâ€™ll be your new go-to for taco night too!</p>
    <p>Making taco seasoning from scratch is super easy and can be cheaper than buying the prepared taco seasoning. Here are the spices I include in my recipe. Feel free to also add paprika, coriander, onion powder and crushed red pepper to give it some heat.</p>

            <li>Mexican oregano</li>

        </ul>
    <p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the ground beef in a skillet with olive oil.</li>
